The plenum-rated line was engineered to overcome common challenges faced by installers. Low-profile connectors (1.5in total depth) save valuable space and enable easier in-wall connections. And the small-diameter (0.25in) cable design further reduces the space and clearance required to run the necessary cabling through walls and plenum air spaces.This cable is constructed from 24 AWG twisted pair wire with foil shielding to ensure signal integrity in your installation. CMP rating provides the fire protection required to run within walls and air plenums without the need for conduit.","meta":{"address":"https:\/\/www.dell.com\/en-us\/member\/shop\/c2g-50ft-35mm-stereo-audio-cable-with-low-profile-connectors-m-m-plenum-cmp-rated-audio-cable-50-ft\/apd\/a3616737\/audio","image_address":"https:\/\/snpi.dell.com\/snp\/images2\/300\/en-us~CN_I797029\/CN_I797029.JPG"}}
