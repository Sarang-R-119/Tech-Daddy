The powerful magnetic force of the circuitry results in dynamic, well-tailored diaphragm response to reproduce deep, clear low frequencies and detailed mid-to-high frequencies. The sound is further enhanced by the exclusive dual-layer, memory-foam earpads, comprised of a firm internal layer and a soft outer layer that provide excellent sound isolation and comfort.In addition to providing high-fidelity wireless audio, the ATH-WS990BT headphones also feature noise-canceling and hear-through functionality that gives you greater control over your interaction with the outside world and its noise. The headphones' selectable active noise-cancelation function dampens the ambient noise for greater enjoyment of the Solid Bass audio in loud environments. Conversely, the selectable hear-through function allows voices in the surrounding area to be heard through the headphones. This lets you listen for important announcements, say in a train station or airport, and hear the voice of anyone who might engage you in conversation.","meta":{"address":"https:\/\/www.dell.com\/en-us\/member\/shop\/audio-technica-solid-bass-ath-ws990bt-headphones-with-mic-full-size-bluetooth-wireless-active-noise-canceling-black\/apd\/aa828636\/audio","image_address":"https:\/\/snpi.dell.com\/snp\/images2\/300\/en-us~AA828636\/AA828636.jpg"}}
