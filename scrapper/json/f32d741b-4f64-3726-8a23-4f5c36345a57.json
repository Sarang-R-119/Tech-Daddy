Many high-end work stations utilize multiple display graphics cards that only have a single LFH-59 or LFH-60 (also known as DMS-59 and DMS-60) connection. A breakout cable is necessary to convert this single connection into two more common monitor interfaces such as DVI or VGA.","meta":{"address":"https:\/\/www.dell.com\/en-us\/member\/shop\/c2g-dvi-cable-dvi-i-f-to-dms-59-m-91-in-black\/apd\/a0751748\/tv-home-theater","image_address":"https:\/\/snpi.dell.com\/snp\/images2\/300\/en-us~A0751748r1\/A0751748r1.jpg"}}
