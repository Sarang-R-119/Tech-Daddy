Often there is not much clearance to fit the cable's connector in the space between the TV and the wall. An additional problem is that the weight of the HDMI cable stresses the HDMI connector. Over time, this stress and the constant plugging and unplugging of cables can cause the HDMI connectors on your HDTV and devices to wear down, become damaged, and even degrade picture quality.Solve both problems and protect your HDTV investment with this port saver adapter. This adapter rotates up to 180\u00b0 to alleviate stress from the HDMI connector by adapting the HDMI cable to virtually any angle, and to enable connection in a tight area. It can also absorb the abuse of repeated plugging and unplugging, and thus protect the HDTV's HDMI connectors. Though compact, our adapter is a quick and easy way to extend the life of your valuable equipment. Gold-plated connectors.","meta":{"address":"https:\/\/www.dell.com\/en-us\/member\/shop\/c2g-90-rotating-hdmi-to-hdmi-adapter-port-saver-female-to-male-hdmi-rotating-adapter\/apd\/a3092783\/tv-home-theater","image_address":"https:\/\/snpi.dell.com\/snp\/images2\/300\/en-us~CN_I628097\/CN_I628097.JPG"}}
