Acoustics. Aesthetics. Craftsmanship. Simplicity. Bring your entertainment to life with a powerful, wireless bass module, four compact satellite speakers - including rear wireless surrounds - a wider center channel speaker and a premium, glass-top control console. Love music? Then you'll love SoundTouch built in for Internet radio, music services like Spotify and Amazon Music, and your stored music collection. See - and hear - for yourself why this is the most uncompromising 5-speaker home theater system we've ever made.With OmniJewel satellite speakers, we're rewriting that history with a chapter on elegance. Each of these tiny speakers features a carefully milled aluminum housing with two acoustic enclosures for dual-opposing drivers. This is the key to creating the first omnidirectional speaker for true 360-degree sound and a more spacious home theater experience. It took a team of 30 people to perfect every last detail, ensuring the acoustics would work with the aesthetics.","meta":{"address":"https:\/\/www.dell.com\/en-us\/member\/shop\/bose-lifestyle-650-home-entertainment-system-black\/apd\/a9336391\/tv-home-theater","image_address":"https:\/\/snpi.dell.com\/snp\/images2\/300\/en-us~A9336391\/A9336391.jpg"}}
