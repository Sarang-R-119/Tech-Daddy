When the headset is docked in the base station in standby mode, it practically stops emitting radio frequency. This reduces the RF emissions to almost zero. When the headset is in use, the eco-DECT technology ensures a safe power output, with minimal emissions. The headset adjusts the radio frequency in four steps depending on the distance between the headset and the base. The closer to the base, the lower its power output. The over-the-ear style is light and comfortable, for all-day use.","meta":{"address":"https:\/\/www.dell.com\/en-us\/member\/shop\/spracht-zum-eco-set-headset-ear-bud-over-the-ear-mount-dect-60-wireless-usb\/apd\/a9732043\/pc-accessories","image_address":"https:\/\/snpi.dell.com\/snp\/images2\/300\/en-us~A9732043\/A9732043.jpg"}}
