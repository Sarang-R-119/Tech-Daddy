With its built-in soundcard, it can stream high-quality audio directly from your computer's USB port, or connect directly to any 3.5mm AUX jack for maximum input flexibility. 3-inch composite drivers ensure a distortion-free bass and midrange, while the 3\/4-inch silk dome tweeters effortlessly produce scintillating highs. A specially tuned bass-port on the rear extends the low end while keeping airflow away from your active workspace. If deep bass is your thing, simply connect a subwoofer to the SUB OUT port and revel in pure low-end bliss.","meta":{"address":"https:\/\/www.dell.com\/en-us\/member\/shop\/kanto-yu2-speakers-usb-25-watt-2-way-bamboo\/apd\/a9760112\/pc-accessories","image_address":"https:\/\/snpi.dell.com\/snp\/images2\/300\/en-us~A9760112\/A9760112.jpg"}}
