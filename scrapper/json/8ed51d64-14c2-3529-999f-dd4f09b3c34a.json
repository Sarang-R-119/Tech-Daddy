The DVI-I single link configuration provides enough bandwidth for resolutions up to 2560x1600 pixels and allows high speed transmission up to 9.9 Gbps. Three analog 30 AWG coaxial lines enable high speed analog transmission.Tri-shielded undermold and braid shield protects against unwanted EMI\/RFI interference. Each coax line is individually wrapped in foam-polyolefin insulation and overwrapped with a braided tinned copper shield. 28 AWG copper conductors are individually insulated in hard-density polypropylene to minimize crosstalk, and ensure high-speed, error-free transmission. Gold-plated contacts provide full conductivity with no data loss. PC and Mac compatible cable supports hot-plugging of DVI display devices.
