The short length of the cable allows for very little excess that would have to be tied up. It is designed specifically to be used in conjunction with an OptiPlex Micro when the Micro is mounted on a Micro All-in-One Stand, Micro AIO Mount for E Series monitors, or the Micro Dual VESA Mount.","meta":{"address":"https:\/\/www.dell.com\/en-us\/member\/shop\/vga-to-vga-cable-18-inches-kit\/apd\/470-aclh\/tv-home-theater","image_address":"https:\/\/snpi.dell.com\/snp\/images2\/300\/en-us~470-ACLH_v1\/470-ACLH_v1.jpg"}}
